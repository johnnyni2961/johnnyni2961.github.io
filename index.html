However, Pinnacle is no ordinary hackathon, its <strong>The Olympics of Hackathons</strong>. Only the top 200 qualifying hackers from across the world compete in Pinnacle, however, there's a twist. Hackers can only qualify for Pinnacle if they are ranked as the winner in any partnering, prestigious hackathons, such as: HackDuke, HackUMass, HackDavis, CruzHacks, Cal Hacks, BostonHacks, Hack Dartmouth, HackPrinceton, HackNYU, HackGT, IvyHacks, UofTHacks, and more!<br><strong>Click on logo to find out more!</strong></span>
